Once per turn: You can discard 1 Spell, then target 1 Xyz Monster you control; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 \"Number C\" monster or 1 \"CXyz\" monster, with the same Type as that monster you control but 1 Rank higher, by using it as material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer its materials to the Summoned monster.) If you discarded a card other than a \"Rank-Up-Magic\" Spell to activate this effect, return that Special Summoned monster to the Extra Deck during the End Phase (even if this card leaves the field).","atk":0,"def":0,"level":0,"race":"Continuous","attribute":null,"card_sets":[{"set_name":"Brothers of Legend","set_code":"BROL-EN092","set_rarity":"Ultra Rare","set_rarity_code":"(UR)","set_price":"0.91"},{"set_name":"Ignition Assault","set_code":"IGAS-EN074","set_rarity":"Common","set_rarity_code":"(C)","set_price":"1.06"}],"card_images":[{"id":49082032,"image_url":"https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49082032.jpg","image_url_small":"https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_small/49082032.jpg"}],"card_prices":[{"cardmarket_price":"0.02","tcgplayer_price":"0.05","ebay_price":"0.99","amazon_price":"0.20","coolstuffinc_price":"0.49"}]}]}
