{"data":[{"id":24639891,"name":"Gunkan Suship Shari","type":"Normal Monster","desc":"''Finally got to visit that harbor specializing in Gunkan Suships that I've been curious about for a while! The premium \"Shari\" here is limited to 2000 Suships a year, and uses specially developed smooth aged rice, giving it extra boldness not found anywhere else. The classy atmosphere made my heart sing, too. The Gunkan Suship served had a perfect balance of vinegar, nigiri, shine, and shape, demonstrating exquisite artisanship. The owner told me, \"We are introducing rich yet mellow scented EDO-FRONT red vinegar in the near future,\" which I'm really looking forward to. However, I was disappointed the surrounding seas were a little noisy... so, giving it 4 stars with hope for improvements in the future.''","atk":2000,"def":0,"level":4,"race":"Aqua","attribute":"FIRE","card_sets":[{"set_name":"2022 Tin of the Pharaoh's Gods","set_code":"MP22-EN127","set_rarity":"Super Rare","set_rarity_code":"(SR)","set_price":"0"},{"set_name":"Dawn of Majesty","set_code":"DAMA-EN011","set_rarity":"Common","set_rarity_code":"(C)","set_price":"0.92"}],"card_images":[{"id":24639891,"image_url":"https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24639891.jpg","image_url_small":"https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_small/24639891.jpg"}],"card_prices":[{"cardmarket_price":"0.07","tcgplayer_price":"0.16","ebay_price":"1.00","amazon_price":"2.95","coolstuffinc_price":"0.39"}]}]}
